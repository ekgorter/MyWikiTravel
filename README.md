###*IOS Iphone App by Elias Gorter 6052274*

###App purpose

* App allows searching and browsing [Wikitravel.org](www.wikitravel.org/en) content.

* App allows creation of "guides", containing saved articles from Wikitravel as chosen by the user.

###App description

When travelling, bringing a travelguide in some form (book, ebook, flyer, tourguide) can greatly enhance the travelling experience. It informs the users about what sights to see, what hotels to sleep in, where to eat and many other things. Each medium used for a travelguide brings its own advantages and disadvantages. A book does not require a battery or internet connection but it may be out of date, can be a heavy thing to bring along and many times it contains more information than is needed for your specific trip. A digital means for getting travel information (for example looking up information on the web) is light, easier to keep up to date and you can look up only the information you need, when you need it. But looking up this information may require an internet connection, which is not always readily available abroad due to extra provider costs or remote locations. Also, having to continuously look up information on the internet may be a nuisance. The goal of this app will be to remove some of the disadvantages of current travelguide media and combine some of their advantages into a useful personal travelguide app to bring along on your trips.



This app aims to allow the user to create a personal travelguide, containing informative articles on all locations to be visited on a certain trip. These articles can be selected and downloaded in advance so they are accessible offline. The source of all travel information articles will be [wikitravel.org](www.wikitravel.org/en). This is a community driven website containing a very large database on countries and locations around the world, with information ranging from transportation and safety instructions to attractions and (historical) background information.  

In this app, the user will be able to create a "guide" which can then be filled with articles from wikitravel about all locations that are to be visited during this trip. The articles can be sorted, for example on a day to day basis. This provides the user with a travelguide that contains only the information needed by the user and accessible offline. This removes the problems of requiring an internet connection during use and being presented with more information than needed.
